## Research Context

### Problem Statement - Rainfall Dataset
Pakistan faces floods and drought more often than anyone can believe in different parts of the country year after year, and the cycle seems to continue infinitely. This dataset aims to determine if there is anything we can learn from history and if we can co-relate with global weather patterns and climate change.

### Problem Statement - Temperature Dataset
Climate change is affecting the world and Pakistan is no different. This is the first of its kind dataset for average temperature in the country for the last 116 years.

### Research Lab Background
**Computer-Human Interaction and Social Experience Lab (CHISEL) @ LUMS**

The Computer-Human Interaction and Social Experience Lab is a collection of individuals that develop solutions to everyday problems with a focus on human-centered design. We all share a common passion for developing solutions, digital and physical, for Pakistani communities. 

**Focus Areas:**
- Education
- Development  
- Disabilities
- Human-centered design solutions

**Mission**: We work on the emergent intersections of design, technology and well-being to improve the psychological impact of everyday tech. We believe that good design and user research can unlock previously untapped solution areas.

## Dataset Composition

### Files Included
1. **rainfall_1901_2016_pak.csv**
   - Monthly rainfall data for Pakistan (1901-2016)
   - Measurements in millimeters (MM)
   - 1,392 records covering 116 years
   - Source: Primary Research

2. **tempreture_1901_2016_pakistan.csv**
   - Monthly temperature data for Pakistan (1901-2016)
   - Measurements in Celsius
   - 1,392 records covering 116 years
   - Source: Secondary Research
   - **Significance**: First of its kind dataset for Pakistan's average temperature over 116 years

### Data Structure
```
Format: CSV
Columns: 3 per file
- Measurement Value (Rainfall_MM / Temperature_Celsius)
- Year (1901-2016)
- Month (January-December)
```

## Research Significance

### Climate Impact
- **Climate Change Context**: Both datasets address Pakistan's vulnerability to climate change
- **Extreme Weather Events**: Pakistan experiences recurring floods and droughts
- **Agricultural Impact**: Weather patterns directly affect crop yields and food security
- **Economic Consequences**: Climate variability impacts GDP and development
- **Social Implications**: Weather extremes affect population displacement and livelihoods

### Historical Context
- **116-year timespan**: Provides long-term climate perspective (1901-2016)
- **Pre-industrial to modern era**: Captures climate change transition period
- **Monthly granularity**: Allows seasonal pattern analysis
- **National-level aggregation**: Represents country-wide climate trends
- **Pioneering dataset**: First comprehensive temperature dataset for Pakistan

## Data Quality Considerations

### Strengths
- **Long temporal coverage**: 116 years of consistent data
- **Complete monthly records**: Systematic data collection
- **Institutional credibility**: Academic research institution
- **Standardized measurements**: Consistent units and methodology
- **Complementary datasets**: Rainfall and temperature from same research group
- **Research continuity**: Both datasets published within days of each other

### Limitations
- **Aggregation level**: Country-level data may mask regional variations
- **Temporal gap**: Data ends in 2016, missing recent climate changes
- **Missing variables**: Limited to rainfall and temperature only
- **Source methodology**: Different research approaches (primary vs secondary)
- **Documentation**: Limited metadata on data collection methods
